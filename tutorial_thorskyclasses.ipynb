    "# thorskyclasses -- a convenient overlay for astropy.coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "## John Thorstensen\n",
    "\n",
    "**thorskyclasses3** is a set of convenience functions that sit atop ```astropy.coordinates, astropy.time```, and ```astropy.units```.  In addition, it calls functions from ```thorskyutils```, which include functionality not included in astropy, and also some routines for relatively lightweight, accurate-enough computations of such things as the local sidereal time and the positions of the moon and sun. \n",
    "\n",
    "The module also imports from the python ```dateutils``` and the time zone library ```pytz```.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim is to provide the infrastructure necessary for a new, all-python version of skycalc, which will have\n",
    "a GUI interface similar to JSkyCalc.  However, the same infrastructure is very useful for such tasks as figuring out which of your data were taken with the moon up, or in twilight, or whether the barycentric corrections are right, and many other applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two data files are needed, ```cartesian_bright.dat``` and ```observatories_rev.dat```.  These list respectively the brightest stars and data on the canned observing sites; in both cases the coordinates used are cartesian.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  The Observation class\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept in ```thorskyclasses3``` is the ```Observation``` subclass.  As its name implies, this is meant to model a single observation, taken from a site on earth, looking toward specified celestial coordinates, and taken at a specified time.  Accordingly an ```Observation``` has these three main attributes:\n",
    "1. ```site```, which is a site on earth comprising of an astropy EarthLocation, a name, and some other data such as time zone;\n",
    "2. ```celest``` which is an astropy SkyCoord object; and \n",
    "3.  ```t```, which is an astropy Time object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ```Observation``` is initialized, these inputs are specified as keyword arguments, any of which can be omitted.  Instantiating an ```Observation``` with no arguments \n",
    "1. sets the ```site``` to a default observatory (MDM in my case), \n",
    "2. sets the time ```t``` to the present computer clock time, and  \n",
    "3. sets the sky position ```celest``` to correspond to the zenith at that site and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example.  Note that native ```astropy``` functions are used for formatted output. \n",
    "```thorskyclasses3``` provides little in the way of output formatting, since astropy already handles this.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE that the \"ErfaWarning\" will appear rather frequently, because ERFA routines called by astropy depend on up-to-date information on such things as small fluctuations in the earth orientation parameters.  These effects are too small to matter for nearly all users, so the warning can be ignored unless you require extremely precise absolute positions.\n",
    "       \n",
    "Here is an example of instantiating an ```Observation``` without arguments.  Your output will vary depending on when you run it!"
